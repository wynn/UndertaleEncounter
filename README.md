# UndertaleEncounter
Edits the currently selected encounter/battle group (for Undertale's debug mode) within the Undertale data file, so you don't have to manually edit it with a hex editor.

Place undertale encounters.txt in the same folder as the executable.
The first time the program is launched, a backup of data.win is automatically created and debug mode is enabled.
This program only works with the last version of Undertale for Windows, 1.01.

Press Home once in-game to start a battle with the selected encounter.
